# The Lucky Runtime Environment

Welcome to the world of Lucky! A statically typed, compiled and (hopefully) safe language! It takes several aspects from other languages and mashes them together! It has a C and Python hybrid syntax, and I intend to implement memory safety Rustlang style! This is a hobby project, not something huge. If it manages to gain enough attention, I'd like to see it become the spiritual successor to Python. It uses LLVM to generate the binary.

The codebase is highly inspired by https://github.com/mbednarski/xdlang

That project seems to be abandoned, so I decided to re-implement it with my own twists.

My end goal is to learn more about compilers and make a language that I can run where performance is critical.
At some point in time, I also want to implement an interpreter for quick debugging/non-production environments.
